## 💡 Technical Decisions Made

1. **Vite over Create React App**
   - Faster builds
   - Better development experience
   - Smaller bundle size

2. **Firebase over Custom Backend**
   - Free tier generous
   - Real-time capabilities
   - No server management
   - Built-in auth

3. **Tailwind CSS over styled-components**
   - Faster development
   - Smaller bundle
   - Better performance
   - Consistent design

4. **TypeScript over JavaScript**
   - Type safety
   - Better IDE support
   - Fewer bugs
   - Self-documenting

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- ✅ Environment variables for sensitive config
- ✅ Firebase security rules defined
- ✅ Client-side validation
- ⏳ Server-side validation (Firestore rules)
- ⏳ Input sanitization
- ⏳ Rate limiting (Firebase built-in)

---

## 📈 Performance Targets

- Time to Interactive: < 2s
- First Contentful Paint: < 1s
- Bundle Size: < 500KB
- Lighthouse Score: > 90

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy (Future)

- Unit tests: Vitest
- Component tests: React Testing Library
- E2E tests: Playwright
- Coverage target: 80%

---

## 📱 Mobile Strategy

- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- PWA capabilities
- Add to home screen
- Offline support (Service Worker)
- Future: React Native app

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Daily active users
- Meals logged per week
- Profile completion rate
- Return user rate

### Health Outcomes
- Average weight loss
- Goal achievement rate
- User satisfaction

---

## 🚀 Ready to Continue!

**Current Status**: Foundation Complete
**Next Task**: Firebase Setup + Authentication

Once Firebase is configured, we can immediately build:
1. Login/Signup forms
2. User dashboard
3. Profile setup with calculator
4. First deployment

**Estimated Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks of focused development
